# Challenge 02 - Portfolio

## Description

As our second week challenge, we were instructed to create a professional portfolio. Now this got my noggin going!
I definitely wanted this to impress, as it's the webpage that potantial employers might see. It helps me show my work and 
how to contact me in an organized way, so it'll be better to provide than a regular resume.
I learnt mostly CSS with this, it was a big headache but I got my way around it, I think ;).

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/EXPECT.gif)
